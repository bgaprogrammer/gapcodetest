To run the application it's required to modify the connection string in the appsettings.json file to target a MySQL database. I tested the app using Azure database for MySQL basic service.

The database is initialized and seeded in the Program.cs file.

By default is created an user with the following data:

username: asesor@jrgapcodetest.com
password: 1234
